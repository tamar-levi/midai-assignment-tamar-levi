I used a basic python image: 3.10-slim to get a light and up-to-date run.
I installed all the dependencies required for the 2 parts
Libraries for YOLO and image processing...
Libraries for the text model
I copied the source code and files into the container
Run script 1 then script 2...

I made sure the container contained the correct code
