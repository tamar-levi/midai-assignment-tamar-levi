I installed ultralytics for use with YOLO
I defined which yolo version to work on - yolov8
I took an image from the computer
Of course I checked if it was there first.
I read it with openCV
I ran the model on this image,
I saved the first result - the one with the highest percentages
I saved the marked image where it should be.
And presented it




I used the YOLO8 model from ultralytics to run object detection on an image.
The process was relatively easy, I only encountered a problem setting the image in the right path and in the end it worked.
I used pre-trained weights to maintain clear inference
And of course the output is saved in the result folder
