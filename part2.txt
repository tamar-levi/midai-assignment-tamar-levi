I chose to use the transformers model because of its high accuracy in converting ready-made texts.
I entered a clear prompt into the document that included all the instructions to convert a specification to a structured JSON file
I made sure to include a requirement in the prompt to locate components and materials, etc.
The document was read from an external PDF file and entered into the prompt



The result obtained from the model was accurate and the JSON structure was correct.
I adjusted the format to check that the materials were grouped and the names matched according to the requirements.
The model was able to identify and associate them with the designated field


Please note, I initially wrote code that used better and more correct AI, but it cost money..
So I changed the code
